## Exercises

The goal of this exercise is to create an AWS AMI image with Jenkins Installed.
- [ ] Change the AMI name to something that you can identify.
Everyone will create AMI images in the same region, so try to be creating with the name
to make sure you can trace which image is yours.

Remember, its easier to make the name of the image descriptive.


- [ ] Navigate to the directory where ami.json is downloaded.

- [ ] Run "packer validate" to valdiate the packer code

- [ ] Run "packer build" to build you AMI. Check in AWS console for the new ami created (make sure that you are in correct region)
